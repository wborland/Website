# Website

This is an old repository for my website that I used to track applications for internships and full time jobs. It was built on a AWS EC2 instance with a python Flask backend, MySQL databse and an HTML bootstrap frontend. I used AWS CloudFront and Route53 for all my DNS and CDN needs. CircleCI and buddy for bulding/testing/deploying.
